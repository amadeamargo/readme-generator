  ## Description:
  The README Generator is an application that allows users to create high-quality README's in an efficient manner. The application prompts users to answer a brief set of questions, accepts user input, and outputs a README according to the template provided in the generateMarkdown.js file.

  ## Installation:
  Run `node index.js` in the terminal to start the application.

  ## Further Development:
  I hope to include a feature wehre users can choose the different sub-sections of their READMEs. This would allow for personalization.

  ## Contributors:
  This application was build with starter code from the Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp Week 9 curriculum.
